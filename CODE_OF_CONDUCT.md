# IDQL Code of Conduct Statement

We commit to the following guidelines as members of the Hexa-org community.

- Foster an open and welcoming community. Each individual contributor adds unique value to the forward momentum of IDQL.
- Treat all members and contributors with dignity, kindness, and respect.
- Promote diversity, equity and inclusion in our community. Actively work to grow the community through new contributors.
- Zero tolerance for abusive and hurtful language as well as discriminatory actions and behaviors.
- Build a community that supports one another and is willing to stand up for others by reporting inappropriate actions
  to IDQL staff and the CNCF.
- Welcome and share open, honest, and constructive feedback without any fear of dismissive or retaliatory behaviors.
- Ensure that all uses of IDQL and the IDQL protocol are both legal and ethical while also prioritizing the security and
  privacy of usersâ€™ identity data.
- Have fun building both IDQL and the IDQL protocol. Improve the everyday experiences of users, developers,
  administrators, and the organizations they represent.
