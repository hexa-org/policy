# IDQL Core Specification

This specification defines the IDQL policy language. IDQL is designed to be a general purpose, platform-neutral 
policy language for use in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. IDQL is intended support:
* Centralized management and control of cloud based applications
* A platform-neutral specification that can be mapped into proprietary policy systems or be interpreted directly
* Existing standard schemas where possible.

## Conventions and Terminology

All IDQL specification use a common formatting convention and terminology. For information see [Conventions](Conventions.md).

## 1.0 Introduction
Identity Query Language (IDQL) is a security policy language that can be expressed in either
[YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/) 
or [JSON (RFC8259)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259). IDQL is used a multi-platform neutral policy 
language for distributed, hybrid, multi-cloud environments. The intent of IDQL is that all components, 
of a cloud based application from network to application layers may manage access regardless of proprietary platform or 
container. IDQL policy may be enforced directly or mapped and converted into 
proprietary platforms that implement IDQL enabled gateways (see: [Hexa Project](https://github.com/idql-org/hexa)).

![IDQL Policy Graphic](../collateral/images/IDQL-rule.png "IDQL-rule")

An IDQL policy rule identifies a `subject` provider that is permitted one or more `actions` against a target 
`object` with an OPTIONAL set of `scopes` that MAY be used in a condition or returned to the target (e.g. dataSet = "US"). 
IDQL policy MAY be expressed in YAML or JSON format.

IDQL is intended to be used with the [Hexa Policy Gateway API](https://github.com/idql-org/hexa) (the "Gateway") which enables retrieval of deployment 
environments and the ability to retrieve, update, and provision policy. The Gateway defines identifiers for the 
assets referred to in IDQL policy such as: 
* `providerId` - The identifier of an Identity Provider (e.g. "myGoogleIDP") that will provide the "subjects" referred to in 
  the policy.
* `assetId` - The identifier of a service or entity where policy is deployed (e.g. "CanaryProfileService").

### Example IDQL Policy

The following shows a policy that users from a provider known as "myGoogleIDP" or entities with an IP address 
matching IP CIDR 192.168.0.1/24 may perform a `createProfile` or `editProfile` action against the target `object` 
`CanaryProfileService`. When from "myGoogleIDP" The`editProfile` action also 
requires that the User `employeeType` be equal to `contract`. 

The YAML representation of an example IDQL policy:
```yaml
---
$schema: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idql-org/IDQL-specs/main/schema/idql-policy.schema.json
idql-policies:
  - id: CanaryProfileGoogleUpdate
    meta:
      vers: '0.1'
      date: 2021-08-01 21:32:44 UTC
      disp: Access enabling user self service for users with role
      app: CanaryBank1
      layer: Browser
    subject:
      subType: op
      provId: myGoogleIDP
      role: canarySelfService
    actions:
      - name: createProfile
        actionUri: accountCreate
      - name: editProfile
        actionUri: accountEdit
    object:
      assetId: CanaryProfileService
      pathSpec: "/Profile/*"
  - id: EditProfileGoogleUpdate AdminContractor
    meta:
      vers: '0.1'
      date: 2021-08-01 21:32:44 UTC
      disp: Access policy enabling contract staff to edit profiles
      app: CanaryBank1
      layer: Browser
    subject:
      subType: op
      provId: myGoogleIDP
    actions:
      - name: editProfile
        actionUri: accountEdit
    object:
      assetId: CanaryProfileService
      pathSpec: "/Profile/*"
    condition:
      rule: User:employeeType eq contract
      action: allow
  - id: CanaryProfileInternalNetUpdate
    meta:
      vers: '0.1'
      date: 2021-08-01 21:32:44 UTC
      disp: Enabling profile update for internal network services
      app: CanaryBank1
      layer: Services
    subject:
      subType: net
      cidr: 192.168.1.0/24
      members:
       - WorkFlowSvcAcnt
    actions:
      - name: createProfile
        actionUri: accountCreate
      - name: editProfile
        actionUri: accountEdit
    object:
      assetId: CanaryProfileService
      pathSpec: "/Profile/*"
```

In the above example, 3 policies are defined:
* The first policy allows users authenticated via a Google IDP with role "canarySelfService" to invoke the actions 
  "createProfile" and "editProfile" on the "CanaryProfileService" asset. In this case, the role would likely be 
  asserted in a JWT assertion.
* In the second policy, contract employees of CanaryBank identified by the condition `User:employeeType eq contract` 
  are permitted to invoke the editProfile action of the "CanaryProfileService". The condition implies the policy 
  decision point is able to access local SCIM, LDAP, or database containing User information.  
* The third policy enables internal services to perform actions and are authorized by IP subnet and a service 
  account "WorkFlowSvcAcnt".

## 2.0 YAML and JSON Schema and Media Types

IDQL MAY be expressed in either [YAML](https://yaml.org) or 
[JSON (RFC8259)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259) form. This specification uses the 
[JSON Schema Specification](https://json-schema.org) to validate 
[IDQL Policy Schema](../schema/idql-policy.schema.json).  

The media type for IDQL YAML is `application/idql+yaml` and `application/idql+json` for JSON formatted content 
(currently not formally registered).

---
## 3.0 IDQL and The Policy Environment

In order to define policy, IDQL assumes a pre-defined set of assets where policy will be deployed which are 
identified by an identifier. Similarly, IDQL assumes a set of 
Identity Providers that define the subjects against which policy decisions are made. In addition to project 
information, policy conditions MAY use contextual attributes to apply conditions against run time request information.

### 3.1 Project Context

IDQL assumes project configuration information (e.g. from the Policy Gateway) that defines the sources `subject` and 
target `object` of data upon which IDQL rules operate. The Policy Gateway provides the following items:
* _Identity Providers_ define `authId` identifiers are used in a `subject` clause in IDQL. Each provider SHOULD 
  have a set of claims which may be used in policy conditions. Where possible, claims from Identity Providers
  should be mapped to definitions from: 
  * OpenID Connect [Claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims). 
  * And, for extended User profile attributes, use 
    [SCIM User schema under IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/scim/scim.xhtml).
* _Assets_ are referenced in the `assetId` attribute of a target `object`. An asset represents on 
  object where policy may be applied. An asset often has a pre-defied set of permissible `actions` (e.g. roles or permissions) that 
  MAY be allowed, denied, and/or scoped in within an IDQL policy rule. 

### 3.2 How Policy Is Deployed

In practice, a Policy Gateway (e.g. [Hexa](https://github.com/idql-org/hexa)) system maps IDQL Policy to each platform and its native policy system.
In different cloud native environments, policy decision and enforcement may occur using different models and methods. 
Policy deployment, processing and enforcement may be local to the asset (e.g. using the 
[Open Policy Agent sidecar pattern](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/integration/#comparison)), 
delivered through a shared service Policy Decision Point (PDP), or handled directly through a platform's administrative 
interfaces, or other method. As a declarative policy system, it is assumed that the policy administrative gateway 
services for IDQL will handle delivery and configuration with the defined policy assets.

#### 3.2.1 Typical Asset Descriptors
A typical asset has attributes such as project id, data center region and other items required by platform vendors 
(such as AWS, Azure, GCP, or other).  For example:

For AWS, the server information needed to identify an asset might include:
```json
{
  "id": "CanaryProfileService",
  "type": "aws",
  "account-id": "xyz",
  "api-id": "a1234567890",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "stage-name": "",
  "http-verb": "",
  "resource-path-specifier": "/Profile/*"
}
```

For Azure, configuration information includes:
```json
{
  "id": "CanaryProfileService",
  "type": "azure.waf",
  "subscription": "s1234567890",
  "resourceGroup": "xyz",
  "api-id": "8763f1c4-0000-0000-0000-158e9ef97d6a",
  "location": "us-east-1",
  "stage-name": "",
  "resource": "/Profile/*"
}
```

For GCP, configuration information could include:
```json
{
  "id": "CanaryProfileService",
  "type": "GCP.compute",
  "projectid": "xyz",
  "region": "",
  "resourceid": "55ec91ba47ba4f44adf0ef3b748e430f"
}
```

In practice, a Policy Gateway will also need to be configured with an appropriate 
administrative credential (not shown) to access and manage target projects and platforms.

In the above example asset descriptors note that each JSON structure has a "type" attribute. A 
policy gateway and policy editor will use `type` to look up asset .

### 3.3 Contextual Attributes

Some policy statements which are applied during a client request require contextual variables. The following neutral 
variables MAY be used to define conditions which are then mapped to the various platforms (e.g. OPA, AWS, Azure, GCP)
if supported.

Request context attributes:
* `req` - Holds information about the incoming request context. E.g. `req.ip` or `req.protocol`.
  * `ip` - The IP address of the requesting client.
  * `protocol` - The protocol portion of the request URI (e.g. HTTP).
  * `time` - The time of the client request
  * `param.<name>` - Returns the value of any request parameter (`<name>`) in the URI following and separated by the 
    ampersand (`&`). If a parameter is repeated, it is treated as a multi-value for the purposes of filter comparison.
  * `uri` - The full request URI sent by the client.
  * `path` - The path portion of the request URI.
  * `query` - Returns any information contained after a `?` in a request URI.
  * `http` - When the protocol used is HTTP, enables access to HTTP request information.
    * `header.<header-name>` - May be used to compare the value of a particular http header specified by `<header-name>`.
    If multiple headers of the same name exists, then the value is considered multi-valued. Any comparison that matches 
    a single-value SHALL be considered a match. For example `req.http.header.authorization sw bearer`.
    * `method` - The HTTP Method used to make the request (e.g. GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH).

Attributes about the current authenticated subject:
* `subject.provId` - The identifier for the provider under which the subject was authenticated. For example, this
  may be used when a subject source is `any` or `anyAuthenticated` but a condition applies to a specific provider.
* `subject.jwt.<claim>` - If a JWT was used, specific claims can be compared where <claim> is the name of a claim. For 
  example `subject.jwt.iss eq my.example.com`
* `subject.roles` - Roles mapped by the provider to the subject if any.
* `subject.saml.<claim>` - If a SAML assertion was used, specific claims can be compared. For example `subject.saml.iss eq my.example.com`
* `subject.prov.<name>` - Provider specific attributes related to a subject may be accessed using the `subject.prov` 
  prefix combined with a `<name>` for the provider specific attribute or claim.

Provider configuration data may be accessed using `provider.<provId>.<name>` where `<provId>` is the provId identifier 
of the configured provider and `<name>` is a configuration parameter name.

See [IDQL Providers Specification](IDQL-providers.md) for information on subject provider configuration.

----
## 4.0 IDQL Policy Statements

A set of IDQL Policy Statements is contained in an array of `idql-policies` which contains 1 or more IDQL "Policy 
statements". The JSON-Schema (`$schema`) for these policies MAY be referenced:
```json lines
 "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idql-org/IDQL-specs/main/schema/idql-policy.schema.json"
```

Each Policy Statement consists of the following attributes:
* `id` - An unique attribute for the policy statement.
* `meta` - Metadata about the policy including versioning and descriptions.
* `subject` - A subject identifying the actors a policy is applied to.
* `actions` - A set of actions that MAY be performed or excluded
* `object` - The target assets against which policy is applied.
* `scopes` - Defines attributes which may be used as additional qualifiers against subjects, actions, actions, or in 
  conditions applied to policy.
* `condition` - A condition specifies either a `rule` or `role` for which the policy applies.

### 4.1 Id Attribute

* `id` - A unique identifier string (REQUIRED) that allows individual policies to be referenced and 
  potentially 
  indicate purpose. An `id` MAY be a [GUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) or 
  simply a unique textual identifier assigned by an administrator.

### 4.2 Meta Information

The `meta` attribute is a top level policy object containing attributes for versioning and information 
organization. All meta attributes are OPTIONAL.

```yaml
$schema: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idql-org/IDQL-specs/main/schema/idql-policy.schema.json
idql-policies:
- id: example-policy
  meta:
    vers: 0.1
    date: 2021-08-01T21:32:44.882Z
    etag: e180ee84f0671b1
    disp: Access policy enabling profile update
    app: CanaryBank1
    layer: external-access
  subjects:
    . . .
  actions:
    . . .
  object:
    . . .
```

Attributes used for versioning of policy statements include:
* `date` - A modification date expressed in `DateTime` format. Value MUST be encoded as a valid `xsd:dateTime` 
  as specified in Section 3.3.7 of XML XSD Definitions (See: 
  [W3C XML Schema Definition Language(XSD) 1.1 Part2: Data Types](http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-2/))
  and MUST include both a date and a time. A `date` SHALL have no case sensitivity or uniqueness.
* `version` - A version identifier used to distinguish different policy versions (e.g. 1.0.1)
* `etag` - A hash value of the mapped IDQL statement per 
  [Section 2.3 of RFC7232](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7232#section-2.3). If etags are supported by the 
  target platform (e.g.
  [Google Cloud Policy](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/policies#etag)), than `etag` is the mapped value from 
  the target platform.  The Policy Gateway SHALL support the use of the etag as a 
  request pre-condition (see RFC7232) to ensure a policy being updated has not already been altered by another entity 
  (administrative system). The Policy Gateway uses either the mapped etag value for comparison, or MAY use 
  comparison of the local etag value. The `etag` value is typically calculated or mapped by the Policy Gateway 
  and returned after an IDQL client creates or modifies an IDQL policy.

Informational attributes include:
* `applicationId` - An OPTIONAL string identifier that may be used to group policy statements pertaining to a common application.
* `description` - An OPTIONAL string containing a description of the intent of the policy.
* `layer` - An OPTIONAL string identifier that may be used to group policy statements in a common container or 
  application layer.

### 4.3 Subject

The `subject` JSON object defines an authentication state (e.g. anonymous) or Identity Provider to 
identify a 
security entity invoking a request. If `subject` is not present, the policy rule is applied to all requests, regardless of authentication 
type and SHALL be treated as equivalent to a subject type (`type`) of `any`.
```yaml
idql-policies:
- id: example-policy
  meta:
    . . .
  subject:
    subType: idp
    provId: myGoogleIDP
    role: goldService
  actions:
    . . .
  object:
    . . .
```
A `subject` is a JSON or YAML object consisting of the following attributes:
* `type` - A text value indicating the type of subject provider being referenced. Supported values include: 
  * `any` - Any subject whether authenticated or anonymous (this is the same is not specifying a subject)
  * `anyAuthenticated` - Any authenticated subject using any Identity Provider
  * `basic` - A subject authenticated using [HTTP Basic Auth (RFC7617)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617).
  * `jwt` - A subject that is authenticated by validating a
    [JWT token (RFC7519, RFC8725)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8725) issued by an [OAuth2 Authorization
    Server (RFC6749)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749).
  * `op` - A subject authenticated with a JWT token issued by an [OpenID Provider](https://openid.net).
  * `saml` - A subject authenticated with an XML SAML assertion using a SAML IDP.
  * `net` - A subject identified by the requesting client's network address expressed as an IP address or 
    [CIDR (RFC1817)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1817) value. 
    Used for access control for internal services.
  * `other` - A custom provider _[TODO: do we need this?]_
* `role` - Defines a role which the subject MUST possess for a rule to apply. A role implies a set of
  actions (i.e. permissions) that provide the ability to execute the actions specified. Multiple role values MAY be 
  specified using a comma separator. When multiple roles are specified, all values must be asserted (treated as an 
  AND).
* `members` - An array of strings representing service account, user, or group that may be matched. A member is 
  dependent on the target platform definition but often is a JWT Subject or a username or account name. If group is 
  specified, the group must be part of the inbound JWT assertion or be defined locally (e.g. in SCIM or database 
  service).

When `type` is one of: `basic`, `jwt`, `op`, `saml`, or `other`, the attribute `authId` specifies the identifier of 
an Identity Provider configured as part of the policy project assets.

### 4.4 Actions

Actions describe the requests, scopes, or permissions that may be performed at a particular service Object. If no 
actions are specified, it SHALL be assumed that the rule permits all actions. Actions can be logical (such as a scope) or a 
filter that compares protocol, method, and path.

```yaml
idql-policies:
- id: example-policy
  meta:
    . . .
  subjects:
    . . .
  actions:
  - name: createProfile
    actionUri: https:POST:/Users/
  - name: editProfile
    actionUri: ietf:https:PUT|PATCH:/Users/*
    condition:
      rule: adminType eq admincontractor
  object:
    . . .
```

An action consists of the following attributes:
* `name` - An OPTIONAL unique identifier for an action.
* `actionUri` - A URI of the form `<domain-urn>:<domain-uri>` where
  * `<domain-urn>` - Is the defining domain for the action. E.g. `ietf`, `arn`, `gcp`, `azure`. For `aws`, use the AWS
    `arn` format. 
  * `<domain-uri>` - Is the domain specific formatted portion of the URI. For example, `arn` denotes Amazon Resource 
    Name and `ietf` denotes IETF based protocols (see below).
* `exclude` - When set to true, the action MAY be used to invert the action. For example, everything is permitted
  except for `https:PUT|PATCH|DELETE:/*`

URIs including paths may contain wildcards (`*`) and may contain
variables denoted by `${<variable>}` where <variable> is the variable name (e.g. calculated by a scope).

#### 4.4.1 Protocol Actions

For IETF protocols (e.g. HTTP), the `<domain-urn>` IDQL prefix is `ietf:`. The `<domain-uri>` is formatted:
> `ietf:<protocol>:<method>:<pathSpec>?<query>`

The IETF domain is defined with:

  * `<protocol>` - Is the application protocol (e.g. FTP, HTTP, IMAP)
  * `<method>` - An associated request method (e.g. GET). Multiple methods may be specified using the `|` 
    (e.g. PUT|PATCH). A value of `*` indicates all methods.
  * `<pathSpec>` - A URI file path (per RFC3986 [Section 3.3](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.3)) 
    which MAY include a wildcard (`*`). For example: 
    `/Users/*`.
  * `<query>` - The request query component (per RFC3986 
[Section 3.4](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986#section-3.4)).
  
#### 4.4.2 Amazon ARN Actions

The `<domain-arn>` IDQL prefix for Amazon is `arn:` which designates an Amazon Resource Name and follows AWS's [ARN 
format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html).
Typically, AWS uses ARNs to refer to resources, sessions, or identities. In the context of an IDQL Action, an [AWS 
Action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_action.html) MAY be used combined with the `arn:` prefix. So for example, the action `ec2:StartInstances` becomes 
`arn:ec2:StartInstances`. In most cases, AWS actions will be formatted:
> `arn:<product>:<action>`

Example actions:

| Type | Example |
|--- | ---|
| EC2 | `arn:ec2:StartInstances`|
| IAM | `arn:iam:ChangePassword`|
| S3 | `arn:s3:GetObject` |

In an Amazon ARN, wildcards (`*`) MAY be used. For example: `arn:s3:*` allows any action on an S3 object.

#### 4.4.3 Microsoft Azure URNs for Actions

The `<domain-arn>` prefix in IDQL for Microsoft Azure actions is `azure:`. Actions in Azure are combined in a [role 
definition](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-definitions) which a subject must be assigned to invoke. Action URNs 
for Azure in IDQL are of the form:
> `azure:{Company}.{ProviderName}/{resourceType}/{action}`

For example:  `azure:microsoft.directory/applicationPolicies/allProperties/read` permits the requesting client to read 
all properties on an application policy. 

A [contributor action](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) 
may be defined in IDQL as:
```json lines
"actions" : [
  {"actionUri": "azure:*"},
  {"actionUri": "azure:Microsoft.Authorization/*/Delete", "exclude": true},
  {"actionUri": "azure:Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write", "exclude": true},
  {"actionUri": "azure:Microsoft.Authorization/elevateAccess/Action", "exclude": true},
  {"actionUri": "azure:Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprintAssignments/write", "exclude": true},
  {"actionUri": "azure:Microsoft.Blueprint/blueprintAssignments/delete", "exclude": true} 
]
```

#### 4.4.4 Google URNs for Actions

The `<domain-arn>` prefix for Google in IDQL is `gcp:`. Google uses roles which contain one or more permissions that 
indicate permissible actions 
(see [Understanding Roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#predefined_roles)).

For the `actionUri`, GCP Roles are expressed as:
> `gcp:roles/<api>.<role>`

For example: `roles/file.viewer` becomes `gcp:roles/file.viewer`.


### 4.5 Object

Objects are assets in a project protected by policy. A policy `object` is an identified asset combined with an optional 
path specification (`pathSpec`).

```yaml
idql-policies:
- id: example-policy
  meta:
    . . .
  subjects:
    . . .
  actions:
    . . .
  object:
    assetId: CanaryProfileService
    pathSpec: /Profile/${User:username}
```

An object consists of the following attributes:
* `assetId` - A unique URI that points to an asset where policy is to be applied.
* `pathSpec` - A string representing a path or path filter including wildcards or variables. A path may contain wildcards (`*`) and may contain
  variables denoted by `${<variable>}` where <variable> is the variable name (e.g. calculated by a scope).
* `pathRegEx` - A [Regular Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) used for matching request paths.

### 4.6 Scopes

Scopes are used to define variables which may be used in `conditions`, `actions` and/or an `object`.

Scope variables may also be returned to applications instead of an allow/deny boolean response. How this is done is 
determined by the Policy Gateway.

```yaml
idql-policies:
- id: example-policy
  meta:
    . . .
  subjects:
    . . .
  actions:
    . . .
  object:
    assetId: CanaryProfileService
    pathSpec: /Profile/*
  scopes:
  - name: adminType
    value: admin-contractor
  - name: workCountry
    value: ${Users:addresses[type eq work].country}
  condition:
    rule: User:employeeType eq contract
    action: allow
```

A scope consists of the following attributes:
* `name` - The name of a variable to define. Scope name values SHOULD avoid naming conflicts with other attribute 
  sources. In the event of a name conflict, the name defined in scope SHALL take precedence.
* `value` - The value to be assigned. The value may be a static string or integer, or may be a string using variable 
  substitution denoted by `${<variable>}` where <variable> is the variable name.  For example: `"admin-${User:employeeType}"`

Note in the above scope example:
* `workCountry` is a scope variable `workCountry` that is defined as the employee's work
address. The qualifier `[type eq work]` selects the work address value from the multi-valued attribute `addresses` and
assigns the value of sub-attribute `country`.
* `adminType` is assigned `admin-contractor` if the User's `employeeType` attribute is equal to `contract`.

### 4.7 Condition
Conditions are used to qualify whether a subject, action, or object is to be applied. 

```yaml
idql-policies:
- id: example-policy
  meta:
    . . .
  subject:
    subType: idp
    provId: myGoogleIDP
  actions:
  - name: createProfile
    actionUri: https:POST:/Users/
  - name: editProfile
    actionUri: https:PUT|PATCH:/Users/*
  condition:
    rule: role eq admincontractor and subject.jwt.iss eq oidc.canarybank.io
  object:
    . . .
```

A condition consists of a `rule` and an optional `action` which describes the impact on the policy:

* `rule` - A matching filter that uses filter expression as specified in Section
  [3.4.2.2 of RFC7644](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7644#section-3.4.2.2). In addition to standard JWT, 
  SAML, and SCIM attribute names, each provider and object may define additional contextual (client ip, path, etc.) 
  attributes that MAY be used during policy evaluation. These may be referred to by their simple name. Scope attribute 
  names MAY also be referred to by their name (e.g. `adminType` from 4.6 above). Contextual attributes per section 3.
  3 MAY also be used; for example: `req.ip eq 192.168.1.10`.

  Rule expressions(filters) MAY be URL-encoded per [Section 2.1 of RFC3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-2.1).

* `action` - Indicates the desired effect of the condition. When omitted, the default is `allow`. Valid values are:
  * `allow` - Proceeds if there is a match.   
  * `deny` - Negates the outcome if there is a match.
  * `audit` - The rule is not enforced, but processing outcome is logged.

## 5.0 Appendix A - Use Cases

### 5.1 General RBAC Policy Examples

This use case will attempt to map the following IDQL Policy to each platform.

Considering the example:
```json
{
  "id": "EditProfileService",
  "meta": {
    "version": "0.1",
    "date": "2021-08-01 21:32:44 UTC",
    "description": "Access policy enabling staff to edit profiles",
    "applicationId": "CanaryBank1",
    "layer": "Browser"
  },
  "subject": {
    "type": "op",
    "providerId": "corpOpenIdProvider"
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "editProfile",
      "actionUri": "accountEdit"
    }
  ],
  "object": {
    "assetId": "CanaryProfileService",
    "pathSpec": "/Profile/*"
  },
  "condition": {
    "description": "Employee access allowed until 2025-01-01",
    "rule": "req.time lt \"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z\"",
    "action": "allow"
  }
}
```
-----
#### 5.1.1 Google Policy

For an application deployed on the Google Cloud Platform, it is assumed that the configuration 
information stores the following variables for the object `CanaryProfileService`.

```json
{
  "id": "CanaryProfileService",
  "type": "GCP.compute",
  "projectid": "xyz",
  "region": "",
  "resourceid": "55ec91ba47ba4f44adf0ef3b748e430f"
}
```

The translated IDQL policy to be applied would be:
```json lines
HTTP POST https://iap.googleapis.com/v1/projects/xyz/iap_web/compute/services/55ec91ba47ba4f44adf0ef3b748e430f
:setIamPolicy
{
  "policy": {
    "version": 3,
    "bindings": [
      {
        "role": "roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor",
        "members": [
          "domain:canarybank.io"
        ],
        "condition": {
          "description": "Employee access allowed until 2025-01-01",
          "expression": "request.time < 2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

   
----
#### 5.1.2 AWS API Policy

Following the same IDQL example in the Google example (Section 7.1.1). The asset information might look like:
In the asset's data, it is assumed that the configuration information stores the following variables for the object
CanaryProfileService`.
```json
{
  "id": "CanaryProfileService",
  "type": "aws",
  "account-id": "xyz",
  "api-id": "a1234567890",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "stage-name": "",
  "http-verb": "",
  "resource-path-specifier": "/Profile/*"
}
```

Likewise, the subject provider `corpOpenIdProvider` maps back to a federated OIDC provider whose URI is:  `idp.canarybank.io`.

An AWS resource is typically defined by:

>`arn:aws:execute-api:region:account-id:api-id/stage-name/HTTP-VERB/resource-path-specifier`

A resource policy may be attached to an 
[API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-control-access-policy-language-overview.html).  Also see 
[API Gateway ARM Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/arn-format-reference.html).

```json
{
    "Version": "0.1",
    "Statement": {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
          "Federated": "idp.canarybank.io"
        },
        "Action": "execute-api:Invoke",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:xyz:a1234567890/*/*/Profile/*",
        "Condition": {
          "DateLessThan": {"aws:CurrentTime": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
        }
    }
}
```

----
#### 5.1.3 Azure App Role

Following the same IDQL example in the introduction (5.1), the asset information might look like:
In the asset's data, it is assumed that the configuration information stores the following variables for the object
CanaryProfileService`.
```json
{
  "id": "CanaryProfileService",
  "type": "azure.waf",
  "subscription": "s1234567890",
  "resourceGroup": "xyz",
  "api-id": "8763f1c4-0000-0000-0000-158e9ef97d6a",
  "location": "us-east-1",
  "stage-name": "",
  "resource": "/Profile/*"
}
```
In Azure, users and groups are assigned roles in the directory using Graph.  You then can add User or Application roles 
to an 
[application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps). 
The azure case is unclear for a federated provider. 

The following policy assigns a role to an application.  When the User is authenticated, the roles claim must include 
the value `accountEdit`.

```json
"applicationId": "8763f1c4-0000-0000-0000-158e9ef97d6a",
"appRoles": [
    {
      "allowedMemberTypes": [
        "User"
      ],
      "displayName": "editProfile",
      "id": "d1c2ade8-0000-0000-0000-6d06b947c66f",
      "isEnabled": true,
      "description": "Access policy enabling contract staff to edit profiles",
      "value": "accountEdit"
    }
  ],
"availableToOtherTenants": false,
```

In addition a [Custom Rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/create-custom-waf-rules) 
must be applied to define the condition:
```json
  {
    "customRules": [
      {
        "name": "EditProfileServiceCondition",
        "ruleType": "MatchRule",
        "priority": 2,
        "action": "Allow",
        "matchConditions": [
          {
            "matchVariable": "RequestHeaders",
            "selector": "Date",
            "operator": "LessThan",
            "matchValues": [
              "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
```
